## Abstract
This project analyzes the sales data of a café over a specific time period using Microsoft Excel. The primary goal is to identify sales trends, assess product performance, and provide insights into customer behavior. By utilizing Excel’s data analysis tools, such as PivotTables, charts, and functions, the project highlights key performance metrics and provides actionable insights for optimizing café operations. Key findings include peak sales periods, best-selling items, and customer preferences.

## Introduction
The café industry operates in a highly competitive environment, where understanding sales patterns and customer preferences is crucial for sustained growth. This project seeks to analyze the café’s sales data to provide insights into business performance. The dataset includes daily sales records over a year, broken down by product, time of day, and transaction amount. The purpose of this analysis is to inform decisions about inventory management, marketing strategies, and pricing by identifying trends, top-selling products, and seasonal effects on sales.

## Methodology
The project was executed in the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Sales data for the café was sourced from its point-of-sale system, including details on product type, transaction amount, date, and time of sale.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Using Excel, data was cleaned to remove duplicates, correct errors, and ensure uniform formatting.
3. **Data Analysis**:
    - **PivotTables**: Created to summarize sales by product, date, and time.
    - **Excel Functions**: Functions like `SUMIFS`, `AVERAGEIFS`, and `COUNTIFS` were used to filter data and compute key metrics such as total revenue, average sales per day, and the number of transactions.
    - **Charts and Graphs**: Excel's charting tools were used to visualize sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior. Bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts were employed to represent different aspects of the data.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: A user-friendly dashboard was developed, showcasing key insights such as total revenue, top-selling products, and peak sales hours.

## Results
The following findings were derived from the café sales analysis:

1. **Sales Trends**:
    - Peak sales occurred during the weekends, with Friday and Tuesday generating the highest revenue.
    - Morning hours (8 AM to 11 AM) accounted for the bulk of daily sales, driven by coffee and breakfast items.
   
2. **Top Products**:
    - The top-selling product was Barista Espresso.
   
3. **Customer Behavior**:
    - The majority of transactions were small, with most customers purchasing one or two items.
    - Sales data indicated a higher average transaction value during the lunch rush, suggesting that customers were more likely to order larger meals or combos at this time.
